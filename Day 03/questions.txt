Question #1
Converting Objects to Arrays
Write a function that converts an object into an array, where each element represents a key-value pair in the form of an array.

Examples
toArray({ a: 1, b: 2 }) ➞ [["a", 1], ["b", 2]]

toArray({ shrimp: 15, tots: 12 }) ➞ [["shrimp", 15], ["tots", 12]]

toArray({}) ➞ []
Notes
Return an empty array if the object is empty.

Question #2
Array of Multiples
Create a function that takes two numbers as arguments (num, length) and returns an array of multiples of num until the array length reaches length.

Examples
arrayOfMultiples(7, 5) ➞ [7, 14, 21, 28, 35]

arrayOfMultiples(12, 10) ➞ [12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120]

arrayOfMultiples(17, 6) ➞ [17, 34, 51, 68, 85, 102]
Notes
Notice that num is also included in the returned array.

Question #3
Return the Objects Keys and Values
Create a function that takes an object and returns the keys and values as separate arrays. Return the keys sorted alphabetically, and their corresponding values in the same order.

Examples
keysAndValues({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 })
➞ [["a", "b", "c"], [1, 2, 3]]

keysAndValues({ a: "Apple", b: "Microsoft", c: "Google" })
➞ [["a", "b", "c"], ["Apple", "Microsoft", "Google"]]

keysAndValues({ key1: true, key2: false, key3: undefined })
➞ [["key1", "key2", "key3"], [true, false, undefined]]
Notes
Remember to sort the keys.

Question #4
Remove Trailing and Leading Zeros
Create a function that takes in a number as a string n and returns the number without trailing and leading zeros.

Trailing Zeros are the zeros after a decimal point which don't affect the value (e.g. the last three zeros in 3.4000 and 3.04000).
Leading Zeros are the zeros before a whole number which don't affect the value (e.g. the first three zeros in 000234 and 000230).
Examples
removeLeadingTrailing("230.000") ➞ "230"

removeLeadingTrailing("00402") ➞ "402"

removeLeadingTrailing("03.1400") ➞ "3.14"

removeLeadingTrailing("30") ➞ "30"
Notes
Return a string.
If you get a number with .0 on the end, return the integer value (e.g. return "4" rather than "4.0").
If the number is 0, 0.0, 000, 00.00, etc... return "0".

Question #5
Find the Second Largest Number
Create a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the second largest number.

Examples
secondLargest([10, 40, 30, 20, 50]) ➞ 40

secondLargest([25, 143, 89, 13, 105]) ➞ 105

secondLargest([54, 23, 11, 17, 10]) ➞ 23
Notes
There will be at least two numbers in the array.
