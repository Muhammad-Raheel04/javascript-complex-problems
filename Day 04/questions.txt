Question #1
Reverse Words in a String
Given an input string, reverse the string word by word, the first word will be the last, and so on.

Examples
reverseWords(" the sky is blue") ➞ "blue is sky the"

reverseWords("hello   world!  ") ➞ "world! hello"

reverseWords("a good example") ➞ "example good a"
Notes
A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters.
The input string may contain leading or trailing spaces. However, your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.
Try to solve this in linear time.

Question #2
Square Every Digit
Create a function that squares every digit of a number.

Examples
squareDigits(9119) ➞ 811181

squareDigits(2483) ➞ 416649

squareDigits(3212) ➞ 9414
Notes
The function receives an integer and must return an integer.

Question #3
Reverse the Number
Create a function that takes an integer n and reverses it.

Examples
rev(5121) ➞ "1215"

rev(69) ➞ "96"

rev(-122157) ➞ "751221"
Notes
This challenge is about using two operators that are related to division.
If the number is negative, treat it like it's positive.

Question #4
Index Multiplier
Return the sum of all items in an array, where each item is multiplied by its index (zero-based). For empty arrays, return 0.

Examples
indexMultiplier([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) ➞ 40
// (1*0 + 2*1 + 3*2 + 4*3 + 5*4)

indexMultiplier([-3, 0, 8, -6]) ➞ -2
// (-3*0 + 0*1 + 8*2 + -6*3)
Notes
All items in the array will be integers.

Question #5
Match the Last Item
Create a function that takes an array of items and checks if the last item matches the rest of the array concatenated together.

Examples
matchLastItem(["rsq", "6hi", "g", "rsq6hig"]) ➞ true
// The last item is the rest joined.

matchLastItem([1, 1, 1, "11"]) ➞ false
// The last item should be "111".

matchLastItem([8, "thunder", true, "8thundertrue"]) ➞ true
Notes
The array is always filled with items.
