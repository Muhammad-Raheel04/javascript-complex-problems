Question # 1
Concatenate Variable Number of Input Arrays
Create a function that concatenates n input arrays, where n is variable.

Examples
concat([1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6, 7]) ➞ [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

concat([1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]) ➞ [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

concat([1, 2], [3, 4]) ➞ [1, 2, 3, 4]

concat([4, 4, 4, 4, 4]) ➞ [4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
Notes
Arrays should be concatenated in order of the arguments

Derivative of a Function
Create a function that takes numbers b and m as arguments and returns the derivative of the function f(x)=x^b with respect to x evaluated at x=m, where b and m are constants.

Examples
derivative(1, 4) ➞ 1

derivative(3, -2) ➞ 12

derivative(4, -3) ➞ -108
Notes
^ in the context of this challenge means "to the power of", also known as the "exponent" operator.

Question # 3
Returning an "Add" Function
Given a number, n, return a function which adds n to the number passed to it.

Examples
add(10)(20) ➞ 30

add(0)(20) ➞ 20

add(-30)(80) ➞ 50
Notes
All numbers used in the tests will be integers (whole numbers).
Returning a function from a function is a key part of understanding higher order functions (functions which operate on and return functions).
